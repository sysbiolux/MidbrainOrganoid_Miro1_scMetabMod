# Check robustness of results with allowing higher O2 uptake (up to 5 fold compared to Glucose uptake)
This directory contains the respective FBAmodels1-4(.mat) and exchange rates data1-4(.xlsx) when allowing for an up-to 5-fold O2 uptake compared to Glucose uptake. Plotting was done with the files and as explaind in the ModelAnalysis directory.
